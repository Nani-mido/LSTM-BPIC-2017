# LSTM-BPIC-2017

The code provided in this repository can be readily used to perform the following predictive tasks:
* Prediction of the next type of activity to be executed in a running process instance
* Prediction of the timestamp of the next type of activity to be executed
* Prediction of the continuation of a running instance, i.e. its suffix
* Prediction of the remaining cycle time of an instance
